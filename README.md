# LSTM-Google-Stock-Prediction

This is an ongoing project as part of the UCSD Data Science Student Society(DS3) Projects Committee 2023. This project began with a dataset of historical S&P 500 data and even though the original goal was to develop a stock reccomendatoin system - i.e use AI and ML techniques to predict the stock movement of a given stock. Given this background, we appraoched it in 2 ways:

Financial Modelling
Scraping Twitter API for stock information - Sentiment Analysis of tweets as a prediction Feature
Modern Portfolio Theory

Since this is an ongoing project there are a lot more Machine Learning and Financial Models we would like to incorporate. We will be adding more to this repository as we improve our implementations
